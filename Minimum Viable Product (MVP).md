# Title: Pedicting The Success or Failure of a Project on Kickstarter 

### Motivation: the project motivation is to predict wither a project will success or not based on certain features. Also, to know how those features are related to the project success. 

#### To start exploring this goal I made several plots that explains the relation between the two following features & the whither the project will be successful or not. Those two features are:
1. the number of project's backers
2. the amount of excess fund (The requested fund - the collected fund)

### The two plots are shown below

                                                               Number of backers Vs Project State

**From the first plot it can be seen that successful projects have very high number of backers usually, while unseccessful ones usually have very few backers**

**From the second plot it can be seen that successful projects get collect more fund than the requested , while unseccessful ones usually don't meet their targets**
